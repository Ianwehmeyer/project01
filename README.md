This project is a basic html website that requires 3 x html pages - style.css - each page needs to link using <a> tag -  should include 1 x img (though I'd like to have more) - include a form that includes at least 3 fields - should use a multi-column layout of images on a gallery page (I will likely have trouble with this) - an implementation of bootstrap's carousel component or tabs component - my repository should be pushed to my GitHub account 

In the future I would like to figure out how to center align the carousel, how to better format the list, and how to add a small logo on the horizontal directory / make the horizontal directory center aligned.

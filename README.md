This project is a basic html website that requires 3 x html pages - style.css - each page needs to link using <a> tag -  should include 1 x img (though I'd like to have more) - include a form that includes at least 3 fields - should use a multi-column layout of images on a gallery page (I will likely have trouble with this) - an implementation of bootstrap's carousel component or tabs component - my repository should be pushed to my GitHub account 

To be honest, I don't understand user stories or wireframes very well. Hopefully I can build a useable website that isn't too clunky. I did watch the bootstrap video but my understanding of carousels and tabs is very limited.
